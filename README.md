This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Firebase JavaScript SDK: configuration errors.  The `firebase-bug.js` file shows an example of incorrect Firebase setup leading to errors. The solution, provided in `firebase-solution.js`, illustrates how to correctly initialize and configure the SDK to avoid these issues.  Ensure you have the correct Firebase configuration file (`google-services.json`) set up correctly in your project.
